# Portfolio Website

## Description
My portfolio website is meant to be a showcase of my projects and work experience. The website currently contains links to my LinkedIn, GitHub, my Resume, and a link to my email.

## Additional Information
A majority of my early projects were not created using Git. I plan to recreate them with the new knowledge I have now and improve them over time. Additionally, I intend to add new projects throughout the rest of the year. Creating this website was my first step to getting a more complete and full repository setup so that I am able to display my skills.
